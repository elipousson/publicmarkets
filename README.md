## [Baltimore's Public Markets](https://elipousson.github.io/publicmarkets/)

**As of January 2017, I am not updating this repository. I plan to publish any additional research on public markets in Baltimore to the [Baltimore Heritage Places site](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/places/) ([repository](https://github.com/baltimoreheritage/places/)).**

This is a collection of excerpts and transcripts of articles, editorials, and letters to the editor published in the _Baltimore Sun_. Find additional information about the history of Lexington Market in this [interactive timeline](https://elipousson.github.io/publicmarkets/timeline) (based on [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sbFy5-OpVE9lUu47ZoDPKs1-s8JZtVeyqM1bYm0Iuag/edit#gid=0)).
